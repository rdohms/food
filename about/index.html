Hi, I&rsquo;m <strong>Rafael Dohms</strong>, PHP Developer extraordinaire, gamer and husband of the lovely <strong>Tiscilla Dohms</strong>. In 2013 our lives took an unexpected twist, when my wife suffered a terrible accident, followed by many months in the hospital and a slow and long recovery. During and after this period I found myself doing something rather unexpected, driving the stove. See cooking was always Tisci&rsquo;s department, not because I believe its a &ldquo;woman&rsquo;s thing&rdquo; but quite simply cause she loved doing it and could not put up with my disasters in the kitchen for more then 5 minutes.</p>

<p>During these months I found myself faced with an endless sequence of pizza&rsquo;s and takeout food, or trying to make something more. My father, who had come to help out during those rough years got me started with a simple family recipe, fondly called &ldquo;Sheiße&rdquo;, the german word for &ldquo;shit&rdquo;. Nothing more then minced meat with rice, but one of my childhood favorites. That was the start of what I now look at as a wonderful adventure.</p>

<p>During the weekends when my wife was home I started with a cake here and a pie there to explore deserts, while always cooking the dinners during the week. That is the one aspect of the Netherlands I love, food is sold in semi-prepared state, chopped vegetables, sliced potatoes, just makes the day to day cooking a breeze. Over the months this became a passion, something I actually enjoy doing (picking a menu is still painful), and this blog is a place for me to share recipes and stories about this great adventure.</p>

<p>Since then my wife has already recovered enough to get back in the kitchen, and I&rsquo;m very happy to now cook alongside her, something she always wanted but never had the patience to try. So I hope this inspires more of you to give it a try and go out there and cook up a storm.</p>
