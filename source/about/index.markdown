Hi, I'm **Rafael Dohms**, PHP Developer extraordinaire, gamer and husband of the lovely **Tiscilla Dohms**. In 2013 our lives took an unexpected twist, when my wife suffered a terrible accident, followed by many months in the hospital and a slow and long recovery. During and after this period I found myself doing something rather unexpected, driving the stove. See cooking was always Tisci's department, not because I believe its a "woman's thing" but quite simply cause she loved doing it and could not put up with my disasters in the kitchen for more then 5 minutes.

During these months I found myself faced with an endless sequence of pizza's and takeout food, or trying to make something more. My father, who had come to help out during those rough years got me started with a simple family recipe, fondly called "Shei√üe", the german word for "shit". Nothing more then minced meat with rice, but one of my childhood favorites. That was the start of what I now look at as a wonderful adventure.

During the weekends when my wife was home I started with a cake here and a pie there to explore deserts, while always cooking the dinners during the week. That is the one aspect of the Netherlands I love, food is sold in semi-prepared state, chopped vegetables, sliced potatoes, just makes the day to day cooking a breeze. Over the months this became a passion, something I actually enjoy doing (picking a menu is still painful), and this blog is a place for me to share recipes and stories about this great adventure.

Since then my wife has already recovered enough to get back in the kitchen, and I'm very happy to now cook alongside her, something she always wanted but never had the patience to try. So I hope this inspires more of you to give it a try and go out there and cook up a storm.
